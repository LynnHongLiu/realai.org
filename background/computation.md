# Computation

Any form of computation we can build must occur as a physical system. Conversely, certain [theoretical perspectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics) indicate that the universe is fundamentally a computational machine. It is possible that breakthroughs towards AGI will come from physical insights of computation. We will monitor progress in computation, including futuristic theories based on physics, such as quantum consciousness ([Penrose 1989](https://www.amazon.com/Emperors-New-Mind-Concerning-Computers/dp/0192861980)).
