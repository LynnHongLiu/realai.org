# Security

[Information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. The focus of this page is on effective procedures to prevent modification and destruction of data, with the goal of maintaining information integrity.

[Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege): In IT practice, it means giving a user account only those privileges needed to perform its intended function. For example, it is [recommended](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc700846.aspx) on Microsoft's website to use "a non-administrator account instead of an administrator account" for daily tasks on a Windows system.
