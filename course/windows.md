# Windows

Microsoft Windows, or simply [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/), is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by [Microsoft](http://realai.org/industry/microsoft/).

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) (WSL) is a compatibility layer included in the Windows 10 anniversary update. It allows Linux executables to run natively on Windows. Linux distributions including [Ubuntu](http://realai.org/course/ubuntu/), OpenSUSE, and SLES now can be obtained from the Windows Store and [installed](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) onto Windows machine.

In theory, WSL should allow developers to seamlessly move between the Windows and the Linux ecosystems, getting the best of both. But in practice it's never easy to get two complex systems to work well together. There are still rough edges to be smoothed. For example, the legacy blue color of Windows Console is very difficult to read on modern high-contrast display. Newer builds of Windows 10 >= 16257 get a set of better-looking new colors, but a tool to apply it to previous builds has not yet been published [as of August 2, 2017](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/08/02/updating-the-windows-console-colors/).
