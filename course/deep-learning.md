* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) is dedicated to making the power of deep learning accessible to all. As of August 2017, it offers two 7-week courses: [Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 1](http://course.fast.ai/) and [Cutting Edge Deep Learning For Coders, Part 2](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html). Part 1 covers basic CNN and RNN. Part 2 covers more advanced projects such as style transfer, GAN, attention, and memory.
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) is a series of 5 fee-based [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) courses created by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). As of August 2017, the series' topics are "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", "Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization", "Structuring Machine Learning Projects", "Convolutional Neural Networks" and "Sequence Models."
