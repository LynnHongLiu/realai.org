# Convolutional Neural Network

A [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) is a neural network that makes substantial use of convolutions. To get started:

Stanford University's master's level computer science course CS231n maintains [a more advanced overview of CNNs](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) on its course web site.

In the [Deep Models](http://realai.org/course/tensorflow/#deep-models) and [GPU](http://realai.org/course/tensorflow/#gpu) sessions of our [TensorFlow](http://realai.org/course/tensorflow/) course, we walk through the basic steps of building a deep CNN model for the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. The [TensorFlow Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) repository on GitHub contains many more models implemented in TensorFlow, including more sophisticated CNNs such as [Inception-v3](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/slim/inception_model.py) and [ResNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/resnet/resnet_model.py).

## Convolution

Other types of convolutions include dilated, transposed, and (spatial or depthwise) separable convolutions:

## Applications

In November 2016, a group of Google researchers used a deep CNN to identify diabetic retinopathy ([Gulshan et al., 2016](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45732.html)), a leading cause of blindness among adults. In January 2017, a group of researchers from Stanford University trained a single CNN to identify skin cancer ([Esteva et al., 2017](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21056.html)).
