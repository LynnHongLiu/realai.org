# Convolutional Neural Network

## Applications

In November 2016, a group of Google researchers used a deep CNN to identify diabetic retinopathy ([Gulshan et al., 2016](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45732.html)), a leading cause of blindness among adults. In January 2017, a group of researchers from Stanford University trained a single CNN to identify skin cancer ([Esteva et al., 2017](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21056.html)).
