# Convolutional Neural Network

A [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN) is a neural network that makes substantial use of convolutions. As of August 2017, a [nicely presented overview](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) of CNN is maintained by a master's level computer science course (CS231n) from Stanford University on its course web site. In the [Deep Models](http://realai.org/course/tensorflow/#deep-models) and [GPU](http://realai.org/course/tensorflow/#gpu) sessions of our [TensorFlow](http://realai.org/course/tensorflow/) course, we walk through the basic steps of building a deep CNN model for the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

## Convolution

Other types of convolutions include dilated, transposed, and (spatial or depthwise) separable convolutions:

## Applications

In November 2016, a group of Google researchers used a deep CNN to identify diabetic retinopathy ([Gulshan et al., 2016](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45732.html)), a leading cause of blindness among adults. In January 2017, a group of researchers from Stanford University trained a single CNN to identify skin cancer ([Esteva et al., 2017](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21056.html)).
