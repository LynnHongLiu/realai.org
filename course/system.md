# System

The goal of this section is to set up productive environments for deep learning research.

## Basic IT 

* Cloud Computing: [Google Cloud Platform](http://realai.org/course/google-cloud-platform/)
* Operating System: [Ubuntu](http://realai.org/course/ubuntu/) is a popular operating system that we will use during this course
* [Text processing](http://realai.org/course/text-processing/) with grep, sed, awk, and regular expressions
* Text editor: [Vim](http://realai.org/course/vim/) 
* Version control system: [Git](http://realai.org/course/git/)
* Python Packages: [conda](http://realai.org/course/conda/), [pip](http://realai.org/course/pip/)

## Installing Libraries from Source

* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) ([documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/)), a fast and scalable build system that only builds what is necessary
* [Wheel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel) ([documentation](http://wheel.rtfd.org/)) is a built-package format for Python with a specially formatted filename and the .whl extension.
* [Lab](http://realai.org/course/lab/): [Installing Sonnet from Source](http://realai.org/course/lab/sonnet-source/)

## Hardware

For those who are interested in building a tangible computer:
