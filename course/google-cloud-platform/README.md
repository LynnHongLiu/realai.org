# Google Cloud Platform

[Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) is an IT infrastructure that offers a range of computing services to its users. [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP) is the public cloud offered by Google. It consists of a set of physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, [around the globe](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/). Commonly used GCP [services](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/cloud-platform-services) include computing & hosting, storage, networking, and big data. [Local currency billing and payments](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6224682) are available for a range of countries and regions.

## Cloud Shell

[Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/)) is a [free](https://cloud.google.com/shell/pricing) shell environment for managing cloud resources. [No SLA applies](https://cloud.google.com/shell/sla) to this service. It enables access to the Cloud SDK [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) tool directly from browser. Cloud Shellâ€™s [features](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/features) include a 5GB free persistent disk storage, and when Cloud Shell is started, it provisions a f1-micro virtual machine instance running Debian. Cloud Shell is intended for [interactive use only](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/limitations). Prolonged usage is not supported and may result in session termination without a warning.

## Google Compute Engine

[Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) (GCE) is a GCP service that delivers scalable, high-performance virtual machines (VMs). It charges for usage based on a [pricing sheet](https://cloud.google.com/compute/pricing) but also offers a [free-trial](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/frequently-asked-questions) for new customers. After sign-up, users will be able to manage [VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) of different machine types. These machine types typically have 1 to 64 virtual CPUs, 3.75 to 240GB memory and are charged at different rates. Each instance requires a disk to boot from. For example, a 10GB boot disk image can be chosen for a VM to run Ubuntu 16.04 [LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS). Virtual machines can be used for many purposes other than AI research.
