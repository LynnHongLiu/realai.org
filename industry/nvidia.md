# NVIDIA Corporation

## Overview

[NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/) Corporation ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia)) manufactures GPUs that can be used for deep learning. In September 2017, it was described as "one of the technology sectorâ€™s hottest companies" in a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/technology/nvidia-chipmaker.html) that attributed its success to a "pivotal gamble" to develop [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html) that turns GPUs "into more general-purpose computing tools."
