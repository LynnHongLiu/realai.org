## Artificial Intelligence

Business Insider [reported in July 2017](http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-research-forms-new-ai-unit-2017-7) that a major long-term goal of Microsoft Research AI is to build "general AI" that would think and reason like a human. This report was [retweeted](https://twitter.com/MSFTResearch/status/885118358261305344) by [@MSFTResearch](https://twitter.com/MSFTResearch). By August, Microsoft [officially listed AI as one of its top priorities, replacing mobile](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/02/microsoft-2017-annual-report-lists-ai-as-top-priority.html).
