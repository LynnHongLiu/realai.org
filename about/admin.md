# Corporate Administration

## Basic Information

Real AI Limited (company registration No. 2466079) is a private company limited by shares, incorporated in Hong Kong ([holidays](https://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/holiday/)) on December 19, 2016.

## Governance

### Annual General Meeting

In general, a Hong Kong company must hold an annual general meeting (AGM) every year, but as a single member company, Real AI is [not required](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/companies_ordinance/faq_meet-res-co-record.htm#03) to do so.

### Company Directors

The [Companies Registry](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/home/index.htm) advises all directors to read this [Guide](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/publications/docs/director_guide-e.pdf) on directors' duties.

### Company Secretary

A private Hong Kong company [must have](http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/faq/faq01.htm#022) a company secretary. Our company secretary is provided by [OneStart](http://www.onestartoffices.com/).

## Finance 

Real AI is currently supported by donations. Our bank account number is 390-693182-883, [Hang Seng Bank](https://bank.hangseng.com/1/2/business/bank-accounts/integrated-business-solutions/faq#12). Please note that we are **not**, and do not intend to be, a [charity under section 88](http://www.ird.gov.hk/eng/tax/ach_tgc.htm) of the Inland Revenue Ordinance in Hong Kong. We plan to include in our Articles of Association clauses that state precisely and clearly our objectives, and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.
